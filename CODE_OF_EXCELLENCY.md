# Code of Excellency
The Code of Excellency is a simple pledge for projects to be welcoming to everyone, regardless of any factors not directly pertinent to the code at hand. This pledge is a blanket statement to define what is and isn't acceptable behavior in a project.

## Conducting Yourself
Any and all behavior done in the project will be kept in a purely technical manner. Things that are not allowed include any comments not relating to the project at hand, for example racism, sexism, and things on other sites/services. Rather, things should be kept objective and relating entirely to the code/issue at hand.

## Maintainer Responsibilities
Maintainers will uphold, and be held to, the standards defined above. Anything from contributions to discussions not kept to this standard are to be removed immediately, with the possibility of the offending user to be banned from the project.

## Reporting
Non-maintainers can report instances of the above conditions being broken by emailing the project maintainer. All sent reports will be screened, and if offending, will have action taken.

## Source
The Code of Excellency (version 1.0) is available at [https://github.com/taizweb/code-of-excellency](https://github.com/taizweb/code-of-excellency) and is available to use for any and all projects.

And as always, be excellent to each other.
